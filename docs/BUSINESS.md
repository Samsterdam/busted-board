# Busted Board — Business Feasibility Analysis

**Last updated: 2026-06-14. Verified claims sourced from 28 primary/secondary sources via 111-agent deep research pass. Claims marked `[3-0]` were unanimously confirmed; `[2-1]` passed with one dissent; `[est]` are estimates not confirmed in this research run.**

## 1. Business Formation

### Recommendation: Home-state LLC first, defer Delaware

| Entity | Year 1 Cost | Ongoing/yr | When to Use |
|--------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Sole proprietor | $0 | $0 | Pre-revenue only. No liability shield, hard to open business bank account. |
| **Home-state LLC** | **$130–200** | **$25–50** | **Recommended now.** Cheapest path with liability protection + business bank account. |
| Delaware LLC | ~$440–540 | $350–450 | Only if out-of-state investors are in the picture. Adds registered agent ($50–150/yr) + $300/yr franchise tax for no benefit at this stage. |
| Delaware C-Corp | ~$500–700 | $400–500 | Only if actively seeking venture capital. Premature otherwise. |

**Line items for home-state LLC:**
- State filing fee: ~$130–200 one-time `[est]`
- EIN from IRS: **$0** (online, 5 minutes)
- Annual report/renewal: $25–50/yr `[est]`
- Business bank account: $0–$15/mo (Mercury or Relay are free for LLCs)
- **Total year 1: ~$130–200**

## 2. Infrastructure Costs by Scale Tier

### Critical: Vercel Hobby is not legal for commercial use

Vercel's TOS defines commercial use as "any deployment used for the purpose of financial gain." Busted Board has Stripe subscriptions → **Vercel Pro ($20/mo) is required from day one.** `[3-0]`

### Tier 1: 100 MAU (Launch)

| Service | Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Vercel | Pro (required) | $20.00 |
| Neon PostgreSQL | Free (0.5 GB, 100 CU-hr/mo) | $0 |
| Upstash Redis | PAYG (~500K cmds/mo) | ~$1.00 |
| Gemini Flash-Lite | ~400 calls × 700 tok avg | ~$0.03 |
| TMDB API | Free tier | $0 |
| **Total infra** | | **~$21/mo** |

### Tier 2: 1,000 MAU

| Service | Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Vercel | Pro | $20.00 |
| Neon | Launch ($0.106/CU-hr + $0.35/GB-mo) | ~$5 |
| Upstash Redis | ~1M commands/mo | ~$2 |
| Gemini Flash-Lite | ~4,000 calls/mo | ~$0.30 |
| TMDB API | Free | $0 |
| **Total infra** | | **~$27/mo** |

### Tier 3: 10,000 MAU

| Service | Plan | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Vercel | Pro (may hit overage) | ~$20–40 |
| Neon | Launch | ~$15–20 |
| Upstash Redis | ~10M commands/mo | ~$20 |
| Gemini Flash-Lite | ~300K calls/mo at 700 tok avg | ~$2 |
| TMDB API | Free | $0 |
| **Total infra** | | **~$57–82/mo** |

### Vendor pricing — confirmed sources

- **Neon Free:** 0.5 GB, 100 CU-hr/mo (doubled from 50 in Oct 2025). `[3-0]` [Source](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/plans)
- **Neon Launch:** $0.106/CU-hr, $0.35/GB-mo, no monthly minimum. `[3-0]`
- **Upstash Redis PAYG:** $0.20/100K commands; first 1 GB storage free; 200 GB bandwidth free. `[3-0]` [Source](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/pricing)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite:** $0.10/1M input tokens, $0.40/1M output tokens (standard tier). Batch/Flex: $0.05/$0.20. `[3-0]` [Source](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing)
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash (standard):** $0.30/1M input, $2.50/1M output — output rate **includes thinking tokens**, so a reasoning-chain call costs 2–4× the headline rate. `[2-1]`

> **Switch from Flash to Flash-Lite if not already done.** At 10K MAU, Flash costs ~$15–30/mo vs Flash-Lite's ~$2/mo. Flash-Lite has no reasoning mode and eliminates thinking-token billing risk.

---

## 3. Stripe Transaction Economics

Stripe standard rate `[est — industry standard, not confirmed in this research run]`: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

The $0.30 flat fee is disproportionately large at low price points:

| Plan | Gross/Subscriber | Stripe Fee | Net/Subscriber | Stripe Take-Rate |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monthly ($3/mo) | $3.00 | $0.387 | **$2.61** | 13% |
| Annual ($25/yr) | $25.00 | $1.025 | **$23.98** | 4.1% |

**The annual plan is 3× more efficient through Stripe. Push it hard.**

---

## 4. Conversion & Retention Benchmarks

### Free-to-paid conversion

| Percentile | Rate | Source |
|------------|------|--------|
| Bottom 25% | < 2.5% | ChartMogul Jan 2026, n=200 `[3-0]` |
| 50th percentile ("good") | 3–5% | ChartMogul Jan 2026 `[3-0]` |
| 75th percentile ("great") | 8–12% | ChartMogul Jan 2026 |

**Critical caveat:** ChartMogul's sample is predominantly **B2B** SaaS. B2C entertainment (Busted Board's actual category) realistically converts at **1–3%** due to abundant free alternatives and discretionary spend. The 3% planning assumption is the **optimistic ceiling for B2C, not the median.** Model 1–2% as base case.

### Year-1 Retention by Plan Type

| Plan | Year-1 Retention | Monthly Churn Implied |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Monthly | 17% | ~14%/mo |
| Annual | 44.1% | ~56% annual churn |

Source: RevenueCat 2025 State of Subscription Apps `[3-0]` [Source](https://www.revenuecat.com/state-of-subscription-apps-2025/)

> Annual plans retain **2.6× more subscribers** after year 1. An 83% annual churn on monthly plans means most subscribers leave before covering your CAC.

### LTV by Plan

**Monthly subscriber LTV:**
- Avg months before churn: 1 / 0.14 ≈ 7.1 months
- LTV = 7.1 × $2.61 = **~$18.50**

**Annual subscriber LTV** (geometric series, 44.1% annual renewal):
- LTV = $23.98 / (1 − 0.441) = **~$42.89**

Annual LTV is **2.3× higher** than monthly. This is the most important number in the model.

---

## 5. Full P&L by Scale Tier

**Assumptions:** 3% conversion (optimistic/B2B) and 1% (B2C reality); all monthly subscribers; Amazon Associates excluded (see section 7).

| Scenario | Gross Revenue | Stripe Fees | Net Revenue | Infra Costs | **Net Monthly** |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| 100 MAU, 3 paid (3%) | $9 | −$1.16 | $7.84 | −$21 | **−$13.16 (loss)** |
| 100 MAU, 1 paid (1%) | $3 | −$0.39 | $2.61 | −$21 | **−$18.39 (loss)** |
| 1,000 MAU, 30 paid (3%) | $90 | −$11.61 | $78.39 | −$27 | **+$51.39 (+68% margin)** |
| 1,000 MAU, 10 paid (1%) | $30 | −$3.87 | $26.13 | −$27 | **−$0.87 (near break-even)** |
| 10,000 MAU, 300 paid (3%) | $900 | −$116.10 | $783.90 | −$70 | **+$713.90 (+91% margin)** |
| 10,000 MAU, 100 paid (1%) | $300 | −$38.70 | $261.30 | −$70 | **+$191.30 (+73% margin)** |

**10,000 MAU annualized:**
- 3% conversion: **~$8,567/yr**
- 1% conversion: **~$2,296/yr**

> **Ad revenue not included above** — see Section 8 for display advertising estimates. At 10K MAU, AdSense alone adds ~$194/mo; Mediavine Journey adds ~$1,455–$3,880/mo on top of these figures.

---

## 6. Break-Even Analysis

**Minimum fixed cost: $20/mo (Vercel Pro)**

Monthly subscribers at net $2.61:
- Break-even = $20 / $2.61 = **8 paying subscribers**

MAU required to reach 8 subscribers:
- At 3% conversion: **~267 MAU** (achievable from a single Reddit post)
- At 1% conversion: **~800 MAU** (1–2 months of SEO traction)

Annual subscribers at net $23.98/yr ($2.00/mo amortized):
- Break-even = **10 annual subscribers ever**
- At 3% conversion: ~333 MAU total to have covered all infra costs

**The break-even bar is extremely low. 8 paying monthly subscribers covers all infrastructure costs.**

---

## 7. Amazon Associates — Don't Model It Yet

The deep research pass could not verify Prime Video affiliate commission rates. What is publicly known:
- Amazon's **digital category pays 0% commission** on streaming purchases and rentals (cut to 0% in 2020)
- **Prime membership bounties pay ~$3–5 per new Prime sign-up** — but only for users who aren't already Prime members. Target audience (cord-cutters with Prime) almost entirely excludes this conversion
- Physical product referrals pay 1–4.5% — not applicable

**Conservative model: $0–5/mo affiliate revenue at 1,000 MAU.** Treat as upside until you have 3 months of real clickthrough → purchase data in the Associates dashboard. The $2/yr average commission per active user used in early planning is unverified and should not be load-bearing.

---

## 8. Site Advertising Revenue

Showing ads to free users (hidden from paid subscribers) is a standard freemium lever. At low MAU it adds pennies; by 10K MAU it becomes a material revenue line that can match or exceed subscription income at realistic conversion rates.

### Ad Network Landscape (as of Q1 2026)

The network landscape shifted significantly in late 2025 and early 2026:

| Network | Minimum Requirement | RPM Range (entertainment, US/Tier 1 traffic) | Verdict |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Google AdSense** | None formal; practical approval requires established audience | $1–$5 | Entry point — viable from day 1 `[3-0]` |
| **Mediavine Journey** | 1,000 sessions/mo (cut from 10,000 in Oct 2025) | $15–$40+ | Step-up option once ~500+ MAU `[3-0]` |
| **Raptive** | 25,000 pageviews/mo + 50% Tier 1 traffic (cut from 100,000 in Oct 2025) | $13–$15 baseline; $47+ in favorable/Q4 conditions | Target at ~3,000–5,000 MAU `[3-0]` |
| **Ezoic** | 250,000 monthly users (raised Feb 2026) | $5–$15 | **Not viable at this scale** `[2-1]` |

> Ezoic's February 2026 policy change effectively removed it from the small-publisher market. Mediavine Journey and Raptive both lowered their bars — the realistic progression is AdSense → Mediavine Journey → Raptive as traffic grows.

### Pageview Assumption

Letterboxd, the closest publicly comparable product, averages **10.88 pages/visit** (SimilarWeb, corroborated by SEMrush at 11.64). `[2-1]` Using a conservative **1 visit/month per MAU** yields ~10 pageviews/MAU/month as a floor — engaged users likely visit 2–4× per month, which would multiply these estimates proportionally.

### Ad Revenue by Scale Tier (free users only, AdSense baseline)

Assumes: 97% of MAU are free users (3% conversion); 10 pageviews/free user/month.

| Tier | Free User Pageviews/mo | Network | RPM Used | Monthly Ad Revenue |
|------|------------------------|---------|----------|--------------------|
| 100 MAU | ~970 | AdSense (only option — sessions too low for Journey) | $2 conservative | **~$2/mo** |
| 1,000 MAU | ~9,700 | AdSense | $2 | **~$19/mo** |
| 1,000 MAU | ~9,700 | Mediavine Journey (if approved) | $15–$40 | **~$146–$388/mo** `[est]` |
| 10,000 MAU | ~97,000 | AdSense (floor) | $2 | **~$194/mo** |
| 10,000 MAU | ~97,000 | Mediavine Journey | $15–$40 | **~$1,455–$3,880/mo** `[est]` |
| 10,000 MAU | ~97,000 | Raptive (once eligible) | $13–$47 | **~$1,261–$4,559/mo** `[est]` |

**Conservative planning rule:** Model AdSense-only ($2 RPM) until Mediavine Journey is approved and generating real data. Mediavine Journey is the material upside unlock — at 10K MAU it outperforms subscription revenue at 1% conversion by 7–20×.

### Revised Net Monthly at 10,000 MAU (additive to Section 5)

| Scenario | Subscription Net | Ad Revenue (AdSense floor) | Ad Revenue (MV Journey mid) | Combined Net |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| 10K MAU, 1% paid, AdSense | +$191 | +$194 | — | **~+$385/mo** |
| 10K MAU, 1% paid, MV Journey | +$191 | — | +$2,668 | **~+$2,859/mo** |
| 10K MAU, 3% paid, AdSense | +$714 | +$194 | — | **~+$908/mo** |
| 10K MAU, 3% paid, MV Journey | +$714 | — | +$2,668 | **~+$3,382/mo** |

### Freemium Tension

Ads on the free tier reduce urgency to convert. The lift in ad revenue must be weighed against potential suppression of conversion rates — no confirmed research on the magnitude of this effect for movie/TV tracking products. Treat the full Mediavine upside as theoretical until 90+ days of real conversion data exists alongside ads. `[est]`

### Key RPM Caveats

- All RPM figures are for **US/Tier 1 traffic**; non-US traffic commands 3–5× less.
- Authenticated, app-like browsing (quick lookups vs. long content reads) may compress RPM below content-site benchmarks.
- Q4 RPMs run 1.5–2× Q1 — use Q1 as the annual planning baseline.
- Ad blockers among tech-savvy cord-cutter audiences could suppress realized RPM by 20–40%. `[est]`
- Raptive's $47+ RPM figure reflects one publisher's Q4 2025 conditions; the Publift-cited baseline of $13–$15 is the more conservative and likely more representative floor.

## 9. Competitive Benchmarks

| Product | Pricing | Model | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Letterboxd** | $19/yr Pro, $49/yr Patron | Freemium + web subscriptions | `[3-0 verified]` Via Paddle; web + iOS + Google Play |
| **Trakt** | $60/yr VIP | Freemium | `[3-0 verified]` **Doubled from $30/yr in Feb 2025.** User exodus is live. |
| **JustWatch** | Free (ad-supported) | Ad revenue | Anchors user price-sensitivity near $0 for feature-comparable use |

**Trakt's 100% price increase is a live acquisition opportunity.** Users displaced from $30/yr → $60/yr are actively seeking alternatives. Busted Board at $25/yr is a credible offer. The r/trakt post should go out while this migration is still happening.

**Letterboxd's $19/yr anchors the "reasonable for a passion-project app" price expectation.** $25/yr is above it but defensible if cross-platform AI recommendations are meaningfully differentiated.

---

## 10. User Acquisition — Organic Only Until 10K MAU

### CAC ceiling (LTV-derived)
Rule of thumb: CAC should be < ⅓ of LTV.
- Monthly subscriber max viable CAC: **~$6**
- Annual subscriber max viable CAC: **~$14**

### Typical paid CAC estimates `[est — not verified]`

| Channel | Cost per Free Signup | Cost per Paid Sub (3% conv) | Viable? |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Reddit organic | $0 | $0 | **Yes — do this first** |
| SEO/content | $0 direct | $0 direct | **Yes — compounds over time** |
| Product Hunt | $0 direct | $0 direct | Yes — week 2 after domain live |
| Reddit Ads | $5–15 | $167–500 | No |
| Google Ads | $7–50 | $233–1,667 | No |
| Meta/TikTok | similar | similar | No |

**Don't spend money on ads until you've validated conversion from organic channels and are self-sustaining at 10K+ MAU.** At 10K MAU with 3% conversion (~$714/mo net), you could allocate $200/mo to Reddit Ads or SEO tools and still profit.

---

## 11. Known Gaps & Unverified Assumptions

| Item | Status | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 3% B2C conversion | Optimistic ceiling, not median — 1% is realistic base case | **High** |
| Amazon Associates revenue | Unverified; likely near $0 | Medium — upside only |
| Vercel Pro overages at 10K MAU | Not confirmed; $20/mo is a floor | Low |
| Annual vs monthly plan mix | P&L above assumes 100% monthly — any annual mix improves all numbers | Skews pessimistic |
| RevenueCat retention (17%/44%) | Mobile app data — web SaaS may retain better | Moderate upside |
| Business formation state fees | Estimated; verify against your actual state's Secretary of State website | Low |
| Ad RPM for authenticated/app-like browsing | Letterboxd RPM data not confirmed; app-like sessions may compress RPM 20–50% vs content-site benchmarks | Medium |
| Mediavine Journey revenue share & lock-in terms | Terms not confirmed in research; may differ materially from the full Mediavine program | Medium |
| Conversion suppression from showing ads to free users | No confirmed data; treat Mediavine upside as theoretical until 90+ days of paired conversion+ad data exists | Medium |

---

## Summary

Break-even requires only **8 paying subscribers** (~267 MAU at 3% conversion). Infrastructure is near-free through 1,000 MAU (~$27/mo). The real business emerges at 1,000+ MAU: at 3% conversion you're profitable at +$51/mo; at 10,000 MAU, ~+$714/mo ($8,567/yr net).

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Post on r/trakt now — Trakt doubled to $60/yr and users are leaving
2. Push annual plan ($25/yr) over monthly ($3/mo) — 2.3× better LTV, 2.6× better retention, 3× lower Stripe cut
3. Form home-state LLC (~$130–200) before collecting any revenue
4. Switch Gemini to Flash-Lite if not already — saves ~$13–28/mo at 10K MAU
5. Don't model Amazon Associates revenue until you have 90 days of real clickthrough data
